# email
This is a bare bones email website created using Django, JavaScript's fetch API, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and SQLite. 

I created this project to help me learn JavaScript. As someone fairly new to web programming, the website was a challenge, but I now feel significantly more comfortable using JavaScript.
